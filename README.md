I am a software developer. I build things for the web, mostly using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Sometimes I also contribute, especially when I get bitten hard by a bug in the framework (which has happened more occasionally than I'd like it to).

In free time, I usually either work on side projects or learn about new stuff related to web development. Or just randomly walk around in a quiet park, because I find them very peaceful. Or watch a *lot* of anime.

I almost always listen to music whenever I can. My taste ranges from beautiful classical masterpieces or movie soundtracks to catchy Japanese popular music. Combinations of the two, like pieces by [Yuki Kajiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Kajiura), are simply perfection ✨
